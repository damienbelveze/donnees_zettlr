<p>are not open, even when designers say they are: sometimes the
sourcecode is dowloadable, sometimes the data with which the AI was
trained are accessible, sometimes the model can be modified. The licence
is generaly not an open licence, but a specific licence designed by
lawyers on the account of the society who built the AI. In all those
cases, AI is not reproducible :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But even the most “open” systems can’t be independently replicated,
due to raw computing requirements. This isn’t the fault of the AI
industry – the computational intensity is a fact, not a choice – but
when the AI industry claims that “open” will “democratize” AI, they are
hiding the ball. People who hear these “democratization” claims
(especially policymakers) are thinking about entrepreneurial kids in
garages, but unless these kids have access to multi-billion-dollar data
centers, they can’t be “disruptors” who topple tech giants with cool new
ideas. At best, they can hope to pay rent to those giants for access to
their compute grids, in order to create products and services at the
margin that <em>rely</em> on existing products, rather than displacing
them.</p>

academic research</p>
<p>What’s the point of looking for previous academic works on a
topic?</p>
<ul>
<li>to identify gaps in scientific research (and lead new
experiments)</li>
<li>to start from where the scientific discussion has stalled and not
reinvent the wheel</li>
</ul>
<p>Do all the works published on a topic have the same value ?</p>
<ul>
<li>they have different purposes : clinical trial, literature review,
data paper, dateset</li>
<li>they have not the same impact (usually is this influence measured
after the number of citations). Some papers are more influencial than
others. Some datasets are more re-used than others.</li>
</ul>
<p>When relevance is the most needed</p>
<p>On a new or very specific subject, when there are still not much
literature published on that topic, relevance is an important criteria
(as well as exhaustivity)</p>
<p>When influence is the most needed</p>
<p>Let’s assume that we want to know on a specific subject what is
trending and what direction research is heading to, we ought to harvest
the most influential studies on a subject?</p>
<p>When exhaustivity is the most needed</p>
<p>If there are only few papers published on a new or very specific
topic, an exhaustive research will be not only possible but also
recommended. In medical sciences, even if there is already a large
literature on a subject, exhaustivity is required to draw a systematic
research. Data will be involved in this search (especially data from
clinical trials) ; these data may be pooled so that new evidence could
be obtained, sometimes without any extra experiment.</p>
<p>According to our goal, our research strategies may vary a lot.</p>
<p>Why reproductibility is important when we speak about research
strategies ?</p>
<p>when you introduce your work by saying (or letting people think) that
this is the amount of all the research done on a subject, anybody would
be right asking you : “how could you be so sure that you have not missed
any publication”? In the internet Era, for non scientific information,
it has become impossible to prove at a given time that we have collected
all the data available on a subject :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The history of twentieth-century conspiracy theories demonstrates
that the interpretive practice does not in fact end but continues to
engage in the search for more connections in the present and past … The
future, when the secret will be revealed, never arrives.” In this
regard, as Jodi Dean observes, the logic of conspiracy theory fits
neatly with that of the online information environment in which we are
overwhelmed by a flood of information which suggests that our knowledge
is always incomplete, that there perpetually remains a layer behind the
scenes that eludes us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(source : [<span class="citation"
data-cites="andrejevicInfoglutHowToo2013">[5]</span>])</p>
<p>If at a given time we want to convince our peers that all the
available scientific information has been gathered by us, then we have
to be transparent with the methods we used to gather these sources,
letting other scientists to reuse the same methods later and identifying
which new papers were published in the meantime.</p>
<p>Transparency is important for reproducibility : if I want to make
sure that the study was let without errors or biases, I need to assess
the requests that were sent to search-engines, I need also to know a bit
about how these search-engines usualy work, and if they work the same
whatever be the user’s history of research for instance. This is what we
call reproductibility or [[reproductibilité|reproducibility]].</p>
<p>Later if I want to replicate the study, I also need the requests
which were performed, in order to discuss them and suggest additionnal
keywords or associations : this is what we call replicability</p>
