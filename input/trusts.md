Définition et historique par [[Cory Doctorow]] ([[@doctorowInternetConHow2023]]) 

>A trust is an organization that holds something of value “in trust” for someone else. For example, you might live near a conservation area that a group of donors bought and handed over to a trust to preserve and maintain. The trust is run by “trustees”—directors who oversee its assets. 
>In the nineteenth century, American robber barons got together and formed trusts: for example, a group of railroad owners could sell their shares to a “railroad trust” and become beneficiaries of the trust. The trustees—the same robber barons, or their representatives—would run the trust, deciding how to operate all these different, nominally competing railroads to maximize the return to the trustees (the railroads’ former owners). 
>A trust was a way of merging all the dominant companies in a single industry (or even multiple related industries, like oil refineries, railroads, pipelines and oil wells) into a single company, while maintaining the fiction that all of these companies were their own businesses. 
>Any company that didn’t sell to the trust was quickly driven to its knees. For example, if you owned a freight company and wouldn’t sell out to the trust, all the railroads you depended on to carry your freight would charge you more than they’d charge your competitors for carrying the same freight—or they’d refuse to carry your freight at all.
