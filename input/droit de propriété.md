>Conflict is a reliable way to know whether or not you're a leftist. As Steven Brust says, the way to distinguish a leftist is to ask "What's more important, human rights, or property rights?" If you answer "Property rights *are* human right," you're not a leftist. Leftists don't necessarily oppose all property rights - they just think they're less important than human rights.

(Cory Doctorow)
