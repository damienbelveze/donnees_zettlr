# etymologie du mot "strike"

> "Strike" is sailing jargon. To strike the sails is to take them down. With the sails down, the ships won't travel. In 1768, London sailors struck the sails of merchant ships, stopping international trade to protest wage cuts. That's why deliberate work stoppages are now called strikes. Direct action so potent it changes the language for more than two and half centuries.
