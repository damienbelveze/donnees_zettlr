# presentation : 

Hi I am Damien
I work in a university wich has three main libraries. 
I organize the work of more or less 15 colleagues, most of them are only occasional trainers in the field of information literacy.
 

Search, Organize, Lay-out, Validate and ethicaly Share information

(SOLVE is the approximate translation of RESOUDRE in french wich means REsearch and Evaluation of documentation and online information)


# Package 2

The aim of the second package (twelve hours, 6 hours online) is to skill students to search information in topic focus databases, such as Pubmed, or French open access Law database. 
In the meantime, we help them to identify expertise from an academic point of view. As an illustration, there are two book covers on the controversial topic of endangered species of polar bears. One of these books was written by a field expert, the other by someone who was graduated in the same field and taught in the same university as the former but is funded and edited by climato-denialist. We show to students how to recognize which is which. We think of climato-denialism as one of the major threats of our era, and see sometimes apologists of so-called *sound-science* who have a non disputable academic profile side with fossile industry and climato-scepticists movements, which could potentialy represent a gread harm for future generations. 

# Package 3 

On their third year, Students have to deliver a written or oral presentation based on a methodic research. The two previous years, we gave them the digital skills and methods to get relevant information and to identify and filter is said of their topic on social or mainstream media. Our efforts at this stage are focused on lay out and intellectual property. In order to make them familial with open licences or authors' rights and plagiarism, we have designed an adventure with Twine. Twine is a Libre tool for telling interactive and non-linear stories. The player has to make choices. A bad choice will have bad consequences and will raise other problems to solve. 

# Conclusion

SOLVE has provided us with an opportunity to revamp how we foster information literacy among students. We have extensively researched and explored various methods to replace the traditional CRAAP test and checklists. We have strived to establish connections that didn't previously exist between our traditional sessions on how to use research databases, on one hand, and the issues of disinformation, notions of expertise, and image authentication, on the other.

However, if we managed to embark some teachers to design activities, we did not succeed up to this day to make them participate to the training sessions. The whole work lays on the shoulders of our about 8 training librarians and the graduate students we can recruit and mobilize, which remains quite few compare to our needs. We hope that the first results collected among a portion of our first and second-year students will raise enough interest to our university board so that we could recruit one or two colleagues to help us reaching our objective : making all undergraduate students participating and getting credits for their participation to SOLVE.

Thank you for your interest on this topic, If you have questions, It will be a pleasure for me to answer them after the presentations cycle.
